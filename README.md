# Disease: Marfan syndrome
Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder (only one copy of the defective gene is required to develop the condition) that affects the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Here is a breakdown of what it does within each of these systems:
* Skeletal - scoliosis, chest wall deformity, tall stature, abnormal joint mobility
* Ocular - ectopia lentis - condition characterized by the displacement or malposition of the eye's crystalline lens from its normal location. It can range from a partial dislocation (lens subluxation) to a complete dislocation (lens luxation), almost always bilateral in MFS
* Cardiovascular system - progressive dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, causes aortic incompetence and dissection; Leading cause of premature death in MFS

Symptoms of this disease include:
* tall stature, long limbs, scoliosis, joint hypermobility, high-arched palate
* aortic root dilatation and dissection (most life threatening)
* mitral valve prolapse
* aortic regurgitation 
* retinal detachment
* myopia
* spontaneous pneumothorax
* and more

Treatments of this disease include:
* Beta-blockers: considered the first-line medication for patients with this disease
* Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Losartan and ARBS can reduce aortic root dilation more than beta-blockers alone
* Surgery: Prophylactic aortic root surgery to prevent aortic dissection or rupture by repairing or replacing the mitral valve 
* Ophthalmological Management: Regular eye exams and interventions for lens dislocation or retinal detachment 1
* Orthopedic Management: Treatment of scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and joint problems
* Lifestyle Changes: avoid high intensity contact sports, maintain a health weight, and avoid smoking 


# Underlying Gene: FBN1
* Primary Gene: FBN1 (Fibrillin-1)
* Located on Chromosome 15 at band q21.1
* Mutations in the FBN1 gene are responsible for approximately 90-95% of Marfan syndrome cases

Genes normally expressed in development and in what tissue are they expressed:
* FBN1 is expressed from early embryonic development through adulthood in a wide variety of tissues
* Its expression is particularly high in connective tissues, cardiovascular structures, and the skeletal system

When these are genes abnormally expressed in Marfan Syndrome and in what tissue are they misexpressed:
* When: Throughout development and in various tissues
* Tissues: Widely expressed, but particularly important in: Skeletal system (bones and joints), Cardiovascular system (aorta and other blood vessels), Ocular system (lens and retina), Skin and Lungs

The abnormal expression of FBN1 affects multiple organ systems:
* Cardiovascular system: Weakening of the aortic wall, leading to aneurysms and dissections
* Skeletal system: Overgrowth of long bones, joint laxity
* Ocular system: Lens dislocation, myopia
* Dura mater: Abnormal enlargement (dural ectasia)

TGFB2 and TGFB3 Genes Contribution
* The Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Marfan Syndrome and related disorders. This pathway is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production.
* TGFB2 and TGFB3 genes encode for TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 proteins, respectively. These are ligands that activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Mutations in these genes have been associated with Marfan-like syndromes and aortic aneurysms.
* Research has shown that alterations in TGFB2 can significantly impact the severity of Marfan Syndrome. For instance, a study found that Tgfb2 haploinsufficiency (having only one functional copy of the gene) led to early death in mice with Marfan Syndrome.
