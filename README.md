# Disease: Marfan syndrome
Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal disorder (only need one copy to develop the condition) that affects the skeletal, ocular, and   cardiovascular systems. Here is a breakdown of what it does within each of these systems:
* Skeletal - scoliosis, chest wall deformity, tall stature, abnormal joint mobility
* Ocular - ectopia lentis - condition characterized by the displacement or malposition of the eye's crystalline lens from its normal location. It can range from a partial dislocation (lens subluxation) to a complete dislocation (lens luxation), almost always bilateral in MFS
* Cardiovascular system - progressive dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, causes aortic incompetence and dissection; Leading cause of premature death in MFS

Symptoms of this disease include:
* tall stature, long limbs, scoliosis, joint hypermobility, high-arched palate
* aortic root dilatation and dissection (most life threatening)
* mitral valve prolapse
* aortic regurgitation 
* retinal detachment
* myopia
* spontaneous pneumothorax
* and more

Treatments of this disease include:
* Beta-blockers: considered the first-line medication for patients with this disease
* Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Losartan and ARBS can reduce aortic root dilation more than beta-blockers alone
* Surgery: Prophylactic aortic root surgery to prevent aortic dissection or rupture by repairing or replacing the mitral valve 
* Ophthalmological Management: Regular eye exams and interventions for lens dislocation or retinal detachment 1
* Orthopedic Management: Treatment of scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and joint problems
* Lifestyle Changes: avoid high intensity contact sports, maintain a health weight, and avoid smoking 


# Underlying Gene: FBN1
* Primary Gene: FBN1 (Fibrillin-1)
* Located on Chromosome 15 at band q21.1
* Mutations in the FBN1 gene are responsible for approximately 90-95% of Marfan syndrome cases

Genes normally expressed in development and in what tissue are they expressed:
* FBN1 is expressed from early embryonic development through adulthood in a wide variety of tissues
* Its expression is particularly high in connective tissues, cardiovascular structures, and the skeletal system

When these are genes abnormally expressed in Marfan Syndrome and in what tissue are they misexpressed:
* When: Throughout development and in various tissues
* Tissues: Widely expressed, but particularly important in: Skeletal system (bones and joints), Cardiovascular system (aorta and other blood vessels), Ocular system (lens and retina), Skin and Lungs

The abnormal expression of FBN1 affects multiple organ systems:
* Cardiovascular system: Weakening of the aortic wall, leading to aneurysms and dissections
* Skeletal system: Overgrowth of long bones, joint laxity
* Ocular system: Lens dislocation, myopia
* Dura mater: Abnormal enlargement (dural ectasia)
